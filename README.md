 Team Everest Project

MUST
[??] Decide on the group name
[ ] Input/hello message - introduction, instruction, num of rounds
[ ] Get user name (also for leader board)
[ ] Generate a random number between 1 and 151 to use as the Pokemon ID number
[ ] Using the Pokemon API get a Pokemon based on its ID number (1st stage)
[ ] Create a dictionary that contains the returned Pokemon's name, id, height and weight and other playing stat we decide on (?https://pokeapi.co/ )
[ ] Get a random Pokemon for the player and another for their opponent
[ ] Ask the user which stat they want to use (id, height or weight)
[ ] Compare the player's and opponent's Pokemon on the chosen stat to decide who wins


SHOULD
[ ] Switch ID to base_experience as a fighting stat
[ ] Get 2 random Pokemon and let the player decide which one that they want to use
[ ] Play multiple rounds and record the outcome of each round. The player with most number of rounds won, wins the game


COULD
[ ] Allow the opponent (computer) to choose a stat that they would like to compare
[ ] Record high scores for players and store them in a file - leader board - record 5 top players (names) & their scores
[ ] Allow the opponent (computer) to get 2 random Pokemon and let it decide which one to use
[ ] Add (types -> type -> name) as a fighting stat (more complex)


WON'T
[ ] Switch to a different API
