# This is our main file and should include as little code as possible (so we do not have merge conflicts when working
# together on the project)

# Functions needed:
#   1) Input/hello message & get player's name
#   2) Play multiple rounds using play_round file
#   3) Decide who wins the game (the player with most number of rounds won, wins the game)

# I have created files that we can utilize to work on different features of the project (see below example)

import test

test.test_hello_function()
