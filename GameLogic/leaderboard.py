# Here we need to write to a csv file the name and score of the winner if it's within the top 5 scores
# Create following functions:
#   1) Check if the score is eligible to show in the leaderboard
#   2) Write current name, score and deck (either PokÃ©mon or NBA) to a leaderboard (sort by score) - comment update
