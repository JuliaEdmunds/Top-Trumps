# Brief: responsible for getting API data
# Functions needed:
#   1) Using the Pokemon API get a Pokemon based on its ID number
#   2) Create a dictionary (Julia: changed to a class/object) that contains the returned Pokemon's name, id, height,
#   weight, base_experience and other playing stat we decide on (â˜…https://pokeapi.co/ )
